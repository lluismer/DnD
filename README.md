# DnD

A Python project where I created a command-line app to manage Dungeon&Dragons Characters and Monsters. It's design to see max-damage and other statistics for a optimize and data driven use of attacks and spells.

## Features

- Create and manage characters with stats (HP, AC, abilities, etc.).
- Turn-based combat loop with initiative and round tracking.
- Basic damage and attack resolution (dice rolls, modifiers).
- Extensible architecture to add new classes, spells, and mechanics.
